# How to run the app

1. Install Node Modules (npm Install)
2. To run program type yarn start on terminal
3. program should be running on localhost:3000


# caveat

Spotify must be running on a seperate Tab. Because this project uses the spotify API, one must be logged in to their spotify account, to then use the  projects functionality (play/skip/pause/etc). However, front-end components should work fine without doing so.
For other users attempting to clone this project and run it, it may/may not work since this project uses the Repo owners client_id for authorization purposes. One can copy/paste their own client_id on the "Login" component after creating a spotify for developers account.
